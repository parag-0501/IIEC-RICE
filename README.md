Problem is :- "Convert the OS based program into a menu driven program using Python Code which will execute the required user query when user will give the input as a text."

> pyttsx3 is used to speak the text which is given.
> os is used to access the system softwares.
> random is used to select random string from start_statement
> time is used to get date and time.
> webbrowser is used to brows in chrome

> I have set some software in the program like (chrome, microsoft edge, notepad, firefox, media player, calculator, paint, disk management, settings, control panel, calendar, help, message , this pc, alarm clock, camera, photos , paint 3d, mail) and a lot can be added to this by using the method which I used.
> one can get info about climate.
> one can search here the things to be browsed on internet.
> we can talk to it... like complementing it, complaining about it.
> we can use don't or do not or any other negative word, as I putted the condition for it somewhere at the end, so that if it does't get true for any other conditions, it will react the same way and say "please don't play with me".
> it can also conquer when we don't give any input and just press enter.
> to close the program we have to use ["exit" , "quit" , "terminate" , "stop" , "close" , "end" , "bye"] one of these words in our input.
> if it doesn't understand any of the above condition the it will search it on internet and provide that to you.
